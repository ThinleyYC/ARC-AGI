# ARC-AGI
AI benchmark that measures our progress towards general intelligence. A system that can efficiently acquire new skills outside of its training data. Approach to learn patterns and make ai model solve problems 

Code editor used: Trae (unlimited access to the Claude 3.7 Sonnet large language model)

After going through the project overview, my goal was to solve atleast 4 out of 16 problems given in the test case as part of Milestone D, which is reflected in the Milestone_Results.csv file. The visuals of the problem can be viewed in the Milestone D file and the daily ARC challenge can be accessed via this link : https://arcprize.org/play 

This was a new domain for Computer reasoning I was not familiar with. I was introduced to training an agent, which was like reinforcement learning but different at the same time, using new code editors and platforms and it was quite a fun challenge. 

I was only to tweak and work with the ArcAgent class and define my methods within that. 

1. feed Forward Neural Network
2. economic_indicators.csv could have been used to understand temporal features and time series data
3. better preprocessing and use of simpe ML models could have better improved the model performance.
